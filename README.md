Steps To Install:
1. Download the zip file from the github
2. open terminal and run command "npm run dev" from the backEnd directory to start the serve
3. open new terminal and run command "npm start" from the frontend directory to start the React app 


I have included all the features in the backend routes but failed to implement them in the frontend part
